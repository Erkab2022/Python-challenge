Python Challenge
The aim of this challenge is to apply Python concepts learned in the courses.PyBank
 In this file, the goal is to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". 
The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
•	The total number of months included in the dataset.
•	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
•	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
•	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
•	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Based on the provided data, we first create a list to store the code. Then, we zip the lists 'Data' and 'Profit losses' together to create a dictionary. 
Afterward, we calculate the sum of the numbers and the average. Next, we retrieve the greatest increase and the greatest decrease. 
Finally, we create a text file to print the output.

PyPoll 
In this Challenge, the task is to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
You will be given a set of poll data called election data. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 
The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
•	The total number of votes cast.
•	A complete list of candidates who received votes.
•	The percentage of votes each candidate won.
•	The total number of votes each candidate won.
•	The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Based on the data, we start by creating separate lists to store the data. We then initialize counters for the total votes and the winning count. 
Next, we loop through the candidate names to count the total votes and determine the number of votes each candidate has received. 
Finally, we set a condition to retrieve the candidate with the most votes and print the output in a text file.
The PyPoll code was created with assistance from Tutor Lebuso Philly.
